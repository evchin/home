    <h2>preface</h2>

    <p>
        
        a confession: i had my first real alcoholic drink during brunch with my favorite compsci college professor. he got us bottomless mimosas and my face was so red by the end (learned i had asian flush that day) that we took a long walk before i went back home so my mom wouldn't know. <br><br>he was an amazing teacher. think whiplash (the movie) but not batshit insane. during one of the busiest semesters id ever had, he gave me two big projects on top of the main class project, set insane deadlines, and wouldn't take no for an answer. id never had more fun in my life. <br><br>a note: i will never mention school anywhere else but in this paragraph because i think school and education could not be on farther ends of the same spectrum. i don't think this was a purposeful failure. i think it is just the result of trying to systematically educate the masses. the greater the quantity, the lesser the quality.
