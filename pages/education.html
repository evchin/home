    <h2>preface</h2>

    <p>i will never mention school anywhere else but in this line because i think school and education could not be on farther ends of the same spectrum. i don't think this was a purposeful failure. i think it is just the result of trying to systematically educate the masses. the greater the quantity, the lesser the quality.</p>

    <h2>what i think education should be</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>personal. every individual's education should be their own hero's journey. <br><br></li>
    </ul>
