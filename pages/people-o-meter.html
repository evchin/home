    <p>late july 2022, i spent a week alone in nyc. usually i had my roommate with me but she was gone visiting family. things were okay the first few days, but gradually, i began to find little to no meaning in doing things i would normally be happy doing. this is a common symptom of depression. a week passed, and one day, i spent some time with a friend and called another. i never felt that feeling again since. <br><br>i learned that i have a people-o-meter that must be filled from time to time in order to not fall into a depression.</p>
