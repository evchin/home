    <h2>writing good</h2>
    
    <p>

        A friend once said that they believed they were a better writer than me. At the time, I was taken back, but chose to laugh it off and ignore the comment. 

        <br><br>It's true, my friend is a wonderful writer. They write long, fluid, poetic sentences with the right phrases in the right spots that make you think the author evidently knows the English language to a T. It's probably true that I don't write as well as they do. 

        <br><br>But I do believe I write good. I write good because I think clear. My sentences will sometimes come out short, choppy, and abrupt, and I'll often use weird words in unsuitable places, but it's always on purpose. It's easy to write something that reads fluently. It's hard to write something that makes you stop. 

        <br><br>Reading an important sentence should make you stop, and the best way I know how to do that is to break a rule. If I didn't make you stop at an important idea, I'd be a bad writer. Then again, you could argue that if I had to break a rule to make you stop, I'd still be a bad writer. I would probably agree.

        <br><br>This is okay to me. I am okay with putting a traffic cone in the middle of the road and waving two red flags if it means you'll stop. Laziness is a far more forgivable sin than having nothing important to say at all. 

        <br><br>"Anxious, inexperienced writers obey rules. Rebellious, unschooled writers break rules. Artists master the form." - Robert McKee (STORY)
