    <h2>preface</h2>

    <p>i think piercings are a coping mechanism for restlessness. it's not the greatest reason, but i love my piercings nonetheless. they make me feel cooler than i am. i know some people wanna spread out their piercings over time; i like to get multiple piercings done at once. i think it's because i'm impatient.</p>

    <h2>state of the union (body)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>8/7/22 (8 piercings): eyebrow piercing fully rejected after 6 months. i kind of ripped it out. it was a good run. i think my eyebrow is permanently scarred.</li>
    </ul>
