    <h2>preface</h2>

    <p>i love my piercings. they make me feel cooler than i am. i know some people wanna spread out their piercings; i like to get multiple piercings done at once. i think it's because i'm impatient.</p>

    <h2>lists</h2>

    <p>state of the union (body)</p>
    <ul>
        <li>8/7/22 (8 piercings): eyebrow piercing fully rejected after 6 months. i kind of ripped it out. it was a good run. i think my eyebrow is permanently scarred.</li>
    </ul>
