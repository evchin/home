    <h2>preface</h2>

    <p>the first time i did improv, i did not know what i was doing, so it felt a bit humiliating, but i also felt very alive. <br><br>when i moved to la, i took improv classes and they were weird because i did not recognize the person i was when i did it. when i play piano, i can grasp onto musician evelyn who has been with me since i was 6. when i do work, i can grasp onto the evelyn who grew up in an asian american immigrant family. when i fence, i can grasp onto competitive evelyn who has existed for as long as i can remember. <br><br>when i am performing on a stage pretending to be someone else, i try to grasp onto someone i have been before, but i come up with nothing, because i have never done anything like it before. it's like a computer searching its cache for an index that was supposed to have the data it needed, but it's not there. it feels difficult and strange and it feels like im building up a new version of me, something i havent had to do since i was a child.</p>

    <p>improv is exciting! it feels foreign. but it feels good.</p>
