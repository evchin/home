    <h2>leaving home</h2>
    
    <p>maybe i'm just stupid but it did not occur to me in the slightest that moving would be an emotionally difficult thing to do until the night before my one-way flight to SF. 
        <br><br>in the past 2 years, i have lived in four different cities. i am no stranger to the act of moving. but for all four moves, i have always done so with the assumption that there was a possibility i'd come back. 
        
        <br><br>but this is the first time i'm moving and crossing a city off my list. i will not be living in LA for likely the next decade, if not for the rest of my life. i got rid of my car. i told myself the traffic was too much, too limiting, and that the city of the arts was too spread out for me to settle here happily.
        
        <br><br>and i still think im right. but it did not occur to me that moving away from such a city that did not fit me at all would be a sad thing. i was so excited that i was counting down the days to my flight, but when it came to the last day, and i had to say all my goodbyes? i can't remember the last time my heart had felt so heavy. from my work friends to my mother to the local Fedex employee i'd grown so familiar with. it all felt so wretched.
