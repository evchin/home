    <h2>preface</h2>

    <p>
      the word "interesting" feels like a fake word. nothing is truly
      interesting to me. there are too many things that are "interesting", which
      is why none of them are "interesting". i am interested in everything, so i
      am interested in nothing.

      <br /><br />
      so when someone says something is interesting, i don't know what that
      means. what does that mean? what makes you interested in something and not
      interested in something else? because i think i could be interested in
      anything if it really came down to it.

      <br /><br />
      so i think the real question is, what matters? what makes me feel truly
      alive and like life is something worth living? now that is an easy answer,
      folks.
