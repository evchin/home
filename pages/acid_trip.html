    <p>

        I am currently in the Tiny Timbers bistro working with Aanahita. Yesterday I tripped acid. Here is what I wrote. <br><br>
        
        ——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————<br>
        So I've just placed a tab of acid on my tongue. And I don't know what to do. I am sitting on the staircase of our tiny home, and I'm expectant and eager for the future, but entirely uncertain of what it holds. I think I want to think about life and its purpose - or rather, my purpose, as I believe it is different for everybody. I have no expectations - instead, I will wait and see what my mind and the universe have in store for me this fine afternoon. :) <br><br>
        
        <i>(author's note: we are a few hours into the acid trip now)</i> I've never felt so ready to cry. But I do not know what I am crying for. Every second, my brain seems to tell me that I can write this from a logical point of view, or I can simply let it come. And I think - why would I even try doing anything of that sort? Every part of me wants to laugh at myself, for my ridiculousness, when I wanted to cry, I could not help but laugh at myself as I did. <br><br>
        
        When I looked at the mirror, I thought I looked strong. My triceps looked fuller than usual.<br><br>
        
        Walk up. That feeling like you’re going to lose control but you’re still in control - remember it.<br><br> 
        
        I am drugged. I am drugged. I think I am better at recognizing it now, as in my mind to control and letting go of it. <br><br>
        
        I don't like the feeling that I've dominated the room. That I'm talking out my feelings and thoughts on her like I'm some majestic being that deserves to be listened to. But also, what if being listened to is just something I need?<br><br>
        
        Yes. You can be in control. Just like you are now, writing this. But is it satisfying? Yes. It is. A different one. Not one of succumbing but one of comprehensivity. <br><br>
        
        This illusion. That you are a keeper of your mind. That you exist, that you control yourself - it is wrong. You are wrong. And that's okay. Let it be. Let your mind be. Trust it. And do not worry too much about those around you - no, their thoughts do not concern you - and that is fair! [EXTRACTED] You are yourself! Stop seeing yourself as side characters to others' beings. [EXTRACTED] Stop it! You are your own. You are your own. You are not you the way that you've been thinking about you. But your mind can be great! If you simply let it be without the restrictions of others - yourself. You must stop getting in your own way! <br><br>
        
        What now?! This is a moment that feels daunting because now I am pondering life's existence on drugs - this is the moment I've been waiting for and now? What will become of it? [EXTRACTED] <br><br>
        
        So? What is it? What is your life’s purpose? <br><br>
        
        It's just me. I am the momentous occasion I've been waiting for. I am all that there is. But the mind is not yours. It hasn't been for the past few hours. So what? Really. Really It is both. It is you. Because there always needs to be a you. But don't you dare forget how it isn't you at all. It is just a mind you have the blessing to control for one brief lifetime. The egoness! The arrogance. You should be ashamed. But - really, it is only the bold who truly believe that are permitted to do what they must. <br><br>
        
        So? You start a new page imagining better words will appear. That your life journey will unravel all before you, like it were so easy to find life's purpose. Just get on acid! How hard? <br><br> 
        
        So now - you must think. That is what's hard. Finding the balance between control and loss of it - working together to figure things out. Taking it sincerely and not too seriously. <br><br>
        
        <b><i>So? So? What is it?</i></b> <br><br>
        
        You are just you. You. Yes. We've gone through this. You avoid the question. [EXTRACTED] <br><br>
        
        I want. I know for sure - [EXTRACTED]. I don't even need to write it down. How? There is no one way. Stop looking for the answer. This is it. This will always be it. Continuous searching. <br><br>
        
        Yes, but that's what I'm trying to avoid! I just want something to start with. That's all. What is my [EXTRACTED]? <br><br>
        
        Do not feel you will overcome it. It will be there. You do not control you - it is an illusion. Writers write what happens to them. <br><br>
        
        Thousand Splendid Suns. <br><br>
        
        Stars. Dunes. <br><br>
        
        A pen’s ink is sturdy. <br><br>
        
        EXPECTATIONS. <br><br>
        
        Be whatever needs to be there. <br>
            Be whatever the world needs you to be. <br><br>
        
        What awaits you is simply eagerness. Here it is! There is the truth. No breakthroughs, no trumpets and galore - it is just the same you hoping for the same answers that will never appear. What lies ahead is up to you. There is no [myen] (a/n: i couldn't read my own handwriting) to it - there is only exploring new things, exploring and failing and falling and failing - that is the story that awaits to be told. <br><br>
        
        What if? What if you cannot save the world? What will be your lasting [rule] (a/n: illegible)? [EXTRACTED] is a sidequest [EXTRACTED], a sidequest that guides you through the most important journey to tell - yourself, your growth, you - an individual made up of her family and friends and heroes. <br><br>
        
        Why is the main quest a side quest? Because this is your life - the world is what it is. Remember - sidequest. <br><br>
        
        So what now? I don’t know. What will you do of yourself? <br><br>
        
        No big life decisions. That was the promise. But now I know that [EXTRACTED] is a pit stop. <br><br>
        
        What will you do? <br><br>
        
        —————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————— <br>
        The pants. The color. Their [wldare] (a/n: illegibile). <br>
            Remember them. Part of your identity. <br>
        ——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————  <br><br>
        
        I've done it. I've looked at the time. I hate that I did. I wish I didn't. Those dreaded expectations are defeating my mind. Not me. My mind. That is one common theme that I must keep track of - But yet here I am. I still feel it. It's here. But. Evelyn. Would you be able to consider that this being who is writing to you, is simply yourself? <br><br>
        
        One thing though. You keep going back to [EXTRACTED]. You need to stop. Stop thinking about the thoughts of others. Stop thinking about whether you matter to them as much as other people do. You must worry only about just y You are human. You are one. You are not a side character. You are you. [EXTRACTED] <br><br>
        
        These pants. Your bare feet. Sand. Sun. <br><br>
        
        What is the meaning of writing? I look at these pages and pages and what are they all for? They give me a sense of pride I don't deserve. <br><br> 
        
        Why must there be a purpose? Why not just write for the sake of it? To think! You must write to think! Stop surprising yourself with truths you already know. You should not be surprised that you are stupid. This should be common knowledge for you. <br><br>
        
        Simply approach the world. <br><br>
        
        I cried like I never cried before. No reason. I just cried as if my whole body wanted it. And I curled up, and I found shelter in my arms and back and shoulders, and I was strong! Yes I was strong! You laughed. You laughed so much when you said that. Yet. Yet. <b>Yet.</b> <b><i>Yet.</i></b> It is true. <br><br>
        
        Stop trying to be anything but what you are. You are endurant. You are. Trust in yourself. Trust that you are strong enough to bear the winds that follow. To be somber is not better. <br><br>
        
        —————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————— <br><br>
        
        That's it. That's what I wrote. I wrote so fervently, so quickly, so harshly and boldly - the bumps made in the paper feel like an unknown Braille against my fingers. It was so satisfying. Such a release. It made me want to begin a paper journal. <br><br>
        
        What have I taken away? <br><br>
        
        Expectations: Expectation is the grandfather of disappointment. Have as close to none as possible. <br><br>
        Let Go: There is no me. I do not have a shred of control over myself. [EXTRACTED] Let it grow without the limits that you've set, falsely believing it to be control. Simply approach the world. Let your mind take over the rest. Trust that it is strong. <br><br>
        Focus: I must embrace the moment as it is. Think purely and intensely on one thing at a time. Focus on yourself and your growth. The rest will follow. [EXTRACTED] is a side quest. <br><br>
        Write: You can write yourself into existence. <br><br>
        A Thousand Splendid Suns: Bare feet against hot sand. Standing upon the sand dunes underneath a thousand splendid suns.
