    <h2>preface</h2>

    <p>i grew up mostly raised by my mom. as an immigrant family from taiwan, there was a lot of tough love. it was only recently that i was able to acknowledge that without anger. while i won't be raising my kids the same way i was brought up, i get now that intentions do matter. i'm grateful to my mother for doing her best. i think she did a great job with the hand she was played.</p>

    <h2>things i've thought about so far</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>no public school. i don't think the school i want for my kid exists yet. i'd like to either build it, or homeschool them.<br><br></li>
        <li>exposure to so many different people and places that they have no concept of what a "normal" person should be.<br><br></li>
        <li>reading books (at least when they're young). knowledge of what good writing is must be built into their bones. <br><br></li>
        <li>letting them make their mistakes (as long as they won't be permanently injured or die) <br><br></li>
        <li>no hitting. it's stupid, primal, lazy, and sadistic. it's immensely disconcerting to be hurt by someone one second and be hugged by them another. <br><br></li>
        <li>no yelling. it's also primal and lazy. <br><br></li>
        <li>learning a musical instrument. fluency in another medium of expression is so gratifying.<br><br></li>
        <li>grow up multilingual. i intend to become fluent enough in mandarin to the point where i can talk to my kid in it and not feel totally awkward. i'd also like to learn a language together.<br><br></li>
        <li>shopping in all sections of the store. none of that boy/girl shit. <br><br></li>
        <li>eat dinner together. no phones. <br><br></li>
    </ul>
