      i started atlas because i wanted to do something hard. i'd just graduated
      college, and after a mere few weeks working full-time at a startup, i knew
      something wasn't quite right. there was too much empty time. i wanted to
      fill it.

      i met syd on yc's cofounder matching platform in june 2023. for those
      without context, this is the equivalent of me saying i met my wife on
      tinder. when i first talked to syd, i felt a little freaked out because it
      felt like we were so similar. i told syd i wanted to work on sublets. they
      said ok, even though maybe they shouldn't have.
