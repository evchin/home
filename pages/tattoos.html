    <h2>preface</h2>

    <p>i just like the way they look. i also think it'd be such a shame to die without permanent scars on you.</p>

    <h2>timeline</h2>

    <p>11/23/22: it's just one right now. but i will certainly be getting another one. probably another two. or ten. twenty. i am still sticking to my original plan of a timeline snaking around my body with all of the important things, and i have an idea of how i want the next three to look like. if tattoos weren't so expensive, i think i'd have an arm sleeve by now.  <br><br></p>
    <p>12/24/22: i got another one yesterday, of the sand dunes, on my lower left bicep. daytime is on the outer side, nightfall on the inner side. it took 4.5 hours, and while the first four hours were fine, the last 30 minutes gradually became so excruciating my body started shivering as a way to release pain. it was the nighttime side, the heavily shaded side, that was being drawn, so it makes sense. a very humbling experience. all i remember is thanking god that pain is ephemeral.<br><br>i'm going to be honest, i don't love how it looks right now. it's too dense and too thin of an arm band to look right. i want to add a sky later on, when my wallet and arm have recovered. i am also already thinking of how i want my sequoia trees to look like. but that will have to wait a while. this process is reminding me of my piercings. i am impatient. <br><br>i started and finished matthew mcconaughey's book greenlights in the first 3.5 hours. it was good. the thing i remember most is when he chose to wrestle the best wrestler in an african village he was visiting. also how his mom wanted some of his spotlight. also how he spoke of his failures and embarassments so candidly. i'd like to do that one day too. i also remember his handshake deal about staying in australia for the full year, no matter how tortorous it was. it helped me get through those last 30 minutes without making a sound.<br><br></p>
    <p>4/25/23: i got my third one a month ago. it's my favorite so far. getting it was a sigh of relief because it's the only one that no one is allowed to see.</p>
