    <p>i think there are few better feelings than getting through a hard thing as a team. <br><br>i also think that everyone advocates for bipartisanship until they don't. some people's limits are higher than others. one person may want two churches to work together. another may want the two political parties to work together. another may want all countries to work together. another may want humans and aliens to work together. but in the end, there will always be an enemy. that is what bonds a team. </p>
