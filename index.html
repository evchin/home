    <p>uh oh. it seems like i have outgrown my website.</p>
    <p>
      I used to have some stuff here. But the problem with writing and creation
      in general is that it feels like everything i make always has a deadline,
      a point when i want to sweep it all away and start clean again. Like
      confession. I write 10 essays that I thought were okay, and then one day I
      read through some, and I think, this no longer represents me anymore. It
      is one of those times; this is me going through confession.
    </p>
    <p>
      in the meantime, everything important about me can be summed up as
      follows: i am building atlas with my co-founder syd, and i love both
      company and co-founder deeply. i love doing improv. i love music, and i am
      trying to learn how to make it, day by day. finally, i am a people person,
      through and through, and i believe people are the only things that matter,
      no matter how hard it can make my life sometimes.
    </p>
    <p>
      if you have a burning desire to talk to someone about something, i can be
      reached at evchin2 via gmail. Please note that while I can listen to just
      about anything, I can only talk about very very little.
