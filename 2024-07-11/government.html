      i feel so strongly about working towards a world where the american
      government once again becomes a magnet for the brightest and most
      passionate people in the world. i think america could be unstoppable if
      the public sector had the agility and the courage to attract the world's
      top talent like it used to.

      <br /><br />the government job should be highly coveted, highly
      compensated, and highly guarded. america's potential is directly tied to
      the public sector's ability to regain its ability to attract top global
      talent, and unfortunately, we are on a losing trend. the current paradigm,
      where the private sector is the primary attractor for brilliance, is
      frankly, a heavy loss and tragedy.
