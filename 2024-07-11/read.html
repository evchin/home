    <h2>preface</h2>

    <p>i don't read all the time. i go through phases of lots of reading and then no reading at all. we read to learn more things and/or understand other people better. i think there are a lot of other ways to do those two things. so i'm not very hard on myself if i go a few weeks without touching a book.</p>
