    <h2>Letter from Jan 2, 2022 to Jan 1, 2023</h2>

    <p>I don't even want to look at past letters. These past 18 years, they also seem like a blur. This summer was when life began. Whatever happened before, that was not life. That was a shadow of one, a blurred reflection shaded in black and white.</p>

    <p>I don't want to predict. All I can be is bemused.</p>

    <p>I'm laughing quite a bit as I look over these past letters. How arrogant, how childish, how lovely this little human being was.</p>

    <p>I hope I do more hard things. I hope I get ripped. I hope I explore new things more, and explore discomfort.</p>
