    <h2>preface</h2>

    <p>
      i grew up mostly raised by my mom. in an immigrant family from taiwan,
      there was a lot of tough love. it was only recently that i was able to
      acknowledge that without anger. while i won't be raising my kids the same
      way i was brought up, i get now that intentions do matter. i'm grateful to
      my mother for doing her best. i think she did a great job with the hand
      she was played.

      <br /><br />i think being a kid is really really hard. i think it can be
      the hardest thing some people have to go through. if you're born with a
      bad hand, there's not really any way out. you don't get choices, and you
      don't get control. your boundaries get to be broken everyday and you get
      forced to do things you don't want to do and everyone laughs when you say
      you're having a hard time because how could you? you're just a kid.

      <br><br>growing up, i was told everyday that life gets harder the older you get. but i swear to you and me and the whole world that those words are so completely and utterly dead wrong that they should have a gravestone of their own. i hope there's a kid out there that's got the spunk in them to make it to 18 so they can make a life of their own and build the family they never had. if you make it to 18, everything else is relatively easy, and i have never believed in anything else so hard in my life.

    <h2>things i've thought about so far</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
        no asking them "what do you wanna be". just "what do you wanna do".
        <br /><br />
      </li>
      <li>
        no public school. i don't think the school i want for my kid exists yet.
        i'd like to either build it, or homeschool them.<br /><br />
      </li>
      <li>
        exposure to so many different people and places that they have no
        concept of what a "normal" person should be.<br /><br />
      </li>
      <li>
        reading books (at least when they're young). knowledge of what good
        writing is must be built into their bones. <br /><br />
      </li>
      <li>
        letting them make their mistakes (as long as they won't be permanently
        injured or die) <br /><br />
      </li>
      <li>
        no hitting. it's stupid, primal, lazy, and sadistic. it's immensely
        disconcerting to be hurt by someone one second and be hugged by them
        another. <br /><br />
      </li>
      <li>no yelling. it's also primal and lazy. <br /><br /></li>
      <li>
        learning a musical instrument. fluency in another medium of expression
        is so gratifying.<br /><br />
      </li>
      <li>
        grow up multilingual. i intend to become fluent enough in mandarin to
        the point where i can talk to my kid in it and not feel totally awkward.
        i'd also like to learn a language together.<br /><br />
      </li>
      <li>
        shopping in all sections of the store. none of that boy/girl shit.
        <br /><br />
      </li>
      <li>eat dinner together. no phones. <br /><br /></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>thoughts on corporal punishment</h2>

    <p>
      there's something about being hit as a kid that just feels like it'll
      always be the worst thing that you'll ever have to deal with for your
      whole life. <br /><br />
      the only time i ever cried during therapy was when my therapist was
      legally required to ask me three questions. what i said in response would
      determine if she would have to call CPS on my mom. and i remember just
      starting to cry in a way that i hadn't cried in since i was a little kid.
      i couldn't stop the tears, and i wasn't even close.
    </p>

    <h2>thoughts on a chinese character: 乖</h2>

    <p>
      there is a word in chinese that i had to hear an insufferable number of
      times growing up: 乖 (romanization: "guai"). it means "well-behaved", most
      often in reference to a child by an elder person. <br /><br />
      it always felt like the most condescending, patronizing, and humiliating
      way to be referred to. "yes! good job for doing exactly what i tell you to
      do!" <br /><br />
      i remember very viscerally that it always gave me the urge to hit the
      person who was saying it. i wanted to hurt them. i wanted to be violent. i
      was probably 6-10yo.
      <br /><br />calling a kid 乖 feels like taking all of the powerfulness
      they feel, compressing it into a ball, and then pitching it straight into
      their gut with all of your adult might. it's incredibly cruel. and i can
      only imagine how dangerous it'd be if you raised a kid to see it like a
      compliment the way the adults always phrase it to be.
