    <p>thank you anthony for helping me get started.</p>

    <h2>entries</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>8/7/22: shifted from focusing on specific muscle groups to full body workouts. really wanna get a pull up down. <br><br></li>
        <li>9/27/22: shifting to a push-pull system - things are getting too intense for full bodies all the time! have been working out 4x/week, using 1 break day for an ice bath. still cannot do a pull up - i am working on it. <br><br></li>
        <li>11/23/22: i am no longer working on a pull up. had one session with a PT who helped me with form and general workout structure. i work out 5x a week with a three day split of chest+biceps+shoulders, back+triceps, and legs. i have hit my 10 pound gain checkpoint! progress feels slow but it always does. i have seen the biggest differences in my arms and back. i think chest and legs will be hell. <br><br></li>
