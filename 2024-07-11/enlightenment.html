    <h2>preface</h2>

    <p>
      one of my friends who lives in the south of france told me about one part
      of buddhist ideology that argues that romantic love between two people is
      selfish, because that love can supposedly be shared with the rest of the
      world if one is enlightened. apparently, a person who reaches
      enlightenment is able to feel the same magnitude of love about everything
      else in the world, instead of limiting it to just one other person.
      <br /><br />

      i think that is such a hot pile of dog shit. i believe this so strongly
      that it makes me angry that you'd even say such a thing.
      <br /><br />

      there are millions of poeple out there in the world who suffer and die
      everyday. and you're trying to tell me, you love each and every one of
      them like you would love your spouse? what are you doing then, up in a
      monastery in a mountain? go save your spouse. go die for your spouse.
      <br /><br />

      love is not something you can just say. love is an action and a choice. if
      you loved someone to the degree that you'd love a lifelong partner, you
      would die for them.
      <br /><br />

      but it's so interesting how those who are "enlightened" tend to isolate
      themselves from the rest of society. it makes me curious. go to a place of
      suffering and tell me how enlightened you are afterwards. take a trip down
      the i-405 every morning and tell me how enlightened you are.
      <br /><br />
      it is easy to be calm and "loving" (i would argue there is nothing loving
      about you) when nothing disturbs you. you are alone in the fucking
      mountains - you better be enlightened, because it doesn't seem like you're
      doing much else. <br /><br />it is far more incredible to be in a place of
      great disturbance and still try your best to be a good person and do good
      upon others.
